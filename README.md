phase-vocoder-java
==================

A simple java library for implementing phase vocoder.  A phase vocoder is a DSP technique used to speed up or slow down the playback speed of music without altering its pitch.

## Goal

The long-term goal of this project is to build a high-performance, easily-used Java library for real-time tempo modification of live music.

## Contributing

This project is at a very early stage in development, but if it succeeds in getting off the ground, I'd be welcome some help expanding it.
